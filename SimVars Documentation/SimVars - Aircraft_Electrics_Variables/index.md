# AIRCRAFT ELECTRICS VARIABLES

The tables below indicate the properties for the Simulation Variables that can be used to get and set variables related to the electrical system of the aircraft. For information on the units listed for each variable, please see here: Simulation Variable Units
NOTE: When Microsoft Flight Simulator is running in multiplayer mode, only a small number of variables are communicated between aircraft. Those variables that are available will say so in the description as being either for "All Aircraft" or for "Shared Cockpit".
You can find a complete index of all available SimVars here: SimVar Index
The SimVars below are all related to the aircraft electrical system (including lights). Large parts of this system are setup using the [ELECTRICAL] section of the system.cfg file, and many may also require the use of the different to retrieve and edit their values.
