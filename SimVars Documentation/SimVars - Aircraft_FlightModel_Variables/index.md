# AIRCRAFT FLIGHT MODEL VARIABLES

The tables below indicate the properties for the Simulation Variables that can be used to get and set properties related to the physical properties and flight model of an aircraft. For information on the units listed for each variable, please see here: Simulation Variable Units
NOTE: When Microsoft Flight Simulator is running in multiplayer mode, only a small number of variables are communicated between aircraft. Those variables that are available will say so in the description as being either for "All Aircraft" or for "Shared Cockpit".
You can find a complete index of all available SimVars here: SimVar Index
