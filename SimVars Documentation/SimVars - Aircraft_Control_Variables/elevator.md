| Simulation Variable | Description | Units | Settable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ELEVATOR DEFLECTION | Angle deflection. | Radians |  |
| ELEVATOR DEFLECTION PCT | Percent deflection. NOTE: This is available in multiplayer. See here for more information: Note On SimVars In Multiplayer. | Percent Over 100 |  |
| ELEVATOR POSITION | Percent elevator input deflection. | Position (-16K to 0) -16K = full down |  |
| ELEVATOR TRIM DISABLED | Whether or not the Elevator Trim has been disabled. | Bool |  |
