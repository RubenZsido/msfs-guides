# Airspeed

| Simulation Variable | Description | Units | Settable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AIRCRAFT WIND X | Wind component in aircraft lateral (X) axis. | Knots |  |
| AIRCRAFT WIND Y | Wind component in aircraft vertical (Y) axis. | Knots |  |
| AIRCRAFT WIND Z | Wind component in aircraft longitudinal (Z) axis. | Knots |  |
| AIRSPEED BARBER POLE | Redline airspeed (dynamic on some aircraft). | Knots |  |
| AIRSPEED INDICATED | Indicated airspeed. | Knots |  |
| AIRSPEED MACH | Current mach. | Mach |  |
| AIRSPEED SELECT INDICATED OR TRUE | The airspeed, whether true or indicated airspeed has been selected. | Knots |  |
| AIRSPEED TRUE | True airspeed. | Knots |  |
| AIRSPEED TRUE RAW | Equivalent to AIRSPEED TRUE, but does not account for wind when used to Set Airspeed value | Knots |  |
| BARBER POLE MACH | Mach associated with maximum airspeed. | Mach |  |
| TOTAL VELOCITY | Velocity regardless of direction. For example, if a helicopter is ascending vertically at 100 fps, getting this variable will return 100. | Feet (ft per second |  |
| WINDSHIELD WIND VELOCITY | Longitudinal speed of wind on the windshield. | Feet (ft per second |  |
