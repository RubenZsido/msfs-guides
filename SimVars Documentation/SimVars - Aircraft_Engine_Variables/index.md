# AIRCRAFT ENGINE VARIABLES

The table below indicates the properties for the Simulation Variables that can be used to get and set properties related to the engines of an aircraft. For information on the units listed for each variable, please see here: Simulation Variable Units
NOTE: When Microsoft Flight Simulator is running in multiplayer mode, only a small number of variables are communicated between aircraft. Those variables that are available will say so in the description as being either for "All Aircraft" or for "Shared Cockpit". Also note that in the multiplayer "Shared Cockpit" mode the only supported index is 1, which means that the data is assumed to be identical for all engines.
You can find a complete index of all available SimVars here: SimVar Index
NOTE: Many of the SimVars listed above require an engine index. This is a value between 1 and 16 that signals which of the engines on the aircraft is being targeted to get or set the value for the SimVar.
