# Variometer

| Simulation Variable | Description | Units | Settable |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| VARIOMETER MAC CREADY SETTING | The MacCready setting used to fly an optimal speed between thermals. | Meters per second |  |
| VARIOMETER NETTO | Variometer rate using Netto (Total Energy - polar sinkRate). | Feet per second |  |
| VARIOMETER RATE | The variometer rate. | Feet per second |  |
| VARIOMETER SPEED TO FLY | Optimal speed to fly between thermals using polar curve and MacCready setting. | Kilometers per hour |  |
| VARIOMETER SPEED TO FLY GLIDE RATIO | The glide ratio at optimal speed to fly. | Number |  |
| VARIOMETER SWITCH | True if the variometer switch is on, false if it is not. | Bool |  |
| VARIOMETER TOTAL ENERGY | The variometer rate using total energy. Total Energy = Potential Energy + Kinetic Energy | Feet per second |  |
