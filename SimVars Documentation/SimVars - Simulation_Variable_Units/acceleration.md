| meter per second squared, meters per second squared | The metre per second squared is the unit of acceleration in the International System of Units (SI). It is equal to the increase in speed in meters per second for every second that passes. |
| feet per second squared, foot per second squared | The foot per second squared is the unit of acceleration in the imperial system. It is equal to the increase in speed in feet per second for every second that passes. |
| Gforce, G Force | The g-force is a measurement of the type of force per unit mass - typically acceleration - that causes a perception of weight. A g-force of 1g is equal to the conventional value of gravitational acceleration on Earth - about 9.8 meters per second squared, or 32.174 feet per second squared. |
| G Force 624 scaled | This is the same as the G Force unit, only scaled by 624 using the formula: VALUE / 624 |
