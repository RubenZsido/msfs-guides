| meter cubed per second, meters cubed per second | A cubic metre per second is a derived International System (SI) unit of volumetric flow rate equal to that of a cube of matter with sides of one metre in length exchanged or moving each second. |
| liter per hour, liters per hour | This is a non-SI unit of volumetric flow rate, defined as the rate at which one liter of matter crosses a given surface during the period of time equal to one hour. 1 liter per hour is equivalent to 0.264172 gallons per hour. IMPORTANT! SimVars that use this unit actually require a value in liters per second (0.264172 gallons per second). This is a hold-over from the legacy FSX simulation. |
| gallon per hour, gallons per hour, gph | This is an imperial unit of volumetric flow rate, defined as the rate at which one gallon of matter crosses a given surface during the period of time equal to one hour. 1 gallon per hour is equivalent to 3.785411784 liters per hour. |
