| Newton meter, Newton, meters, nm | The newton meter is a unit of torque in the International System of Units (SI). One newton-metre is equal to the torque resulting from a force of one newton applied perpendicularly to the end of a moment arm that is one metre long. |
| foot-pound, foot pound, ft-lbs, foot-pounds | The foot-pound is a unit of energy in the imperial unit of measure. It is the energy transferred upon applying a force of one pound-force through a linear displacement of one foot. The corresponding SI unit is the joule. |
| lbf-feet | A pound-foot is a unit of torque representing one pound of force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point. Conversely one pound-foot is the moment about an axis that applies one pound-force at a radius of one foot. |
| kilogram meter, kilogram meters, kgf meter, kgf meters | A kilogram-force meter is an International System of Units (SI) unit of torque representing one kilogram-force applied perpendicularly to a one-meter long moment arm. |
| poundal feet | One poundal is the force that accelerates a mass of 1 pound at a rate of one foot per second per second. So a poundal foot is a unit of torque representing one poundal of force acting at a perpendicular distance of one foot from a pivot point. |
