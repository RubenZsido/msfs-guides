# Pressure

| Units | Description |
| --- | --- |
| pascal, pascals, Pa | The pascal is the SI derived unit of pressure used to quantify internal pressure. The unit, is defined as one newton per square meter. |
| kilopascal, kpa | This is a measure of pressure equivalent to 1,000 pascal (103 pascal). |
| millimeter of mercury, millimeters of mercury, mmHg | A millimeter of mercury is a unit of pressure. It is defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one millimeter high under the force of 1 gravity. It is equivalent to 133.322 pascals, or 0.019337psi. |
| centimeter of mercury, centimeters of mercury, cmHg | A centimeter of mercury is a unit of pressure. It is defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one centimeter high under the force of 1 gravity. It is equivalent to 1333.223 pascals, or 0.193367psi. |
| inch of mercury, inches of mercury, inHg | An inch of mercury is a unit of pressure. It is defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of mercury one centimeter high under the force of 1 gravity. It is equivalent to 3386.39 pascals, or 0.491154psi. |
| inHg 64 over 64k | This unit is for inches of mercury, only the value has been scaled using the following formula: (64.0 / 65536.0) * VALUE. Generally only required for describing units of manifold pressure. |
| millimeter of water, millimeters of water | A millimeter of water is a unit of pressure. It is defined as the extra pressure generated by a column of water 1 mm high with a density of 1 gram per cubic centimeter, under the force of 1 gravity. It is equivalent to 9.80638 pascals, or 0.0014223psi. |
| Newton per square meter, newtons per square meter | Newtons per square meter is a unit that shows how the pascal unit is derived from other SI units. 1 newton per square meter equals 1 pascal. |
| kilogram force per square centimeter, KgFSqCm | Kilogram force per square centimeter is a unit of pressure which is not a part of the International System of Units (SI). It is equivalent to 98066.5 pascals, or 14.2233psi. |
| kilogram meter squared, kilograms meter squared | Kilograms per square meter is a unit of measurement of surface density. It is equivalent to 9.80665 pascals, or 0.001423psi. |
| atmosphere, atmospheres, atm | The atmosphere is a unit of pressure defined as approximately equal to Earth's atmospheric pressure at sea level. It is equivalent to 101325 pascals, or 14.6959psi. |
| bar, bars | The bar is a metric unit of pressure, but not part of the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as exactly equal to 100,000 pascals, equivalent to 14.50378psi. |
| millibar, millibars, mbar, mbars, hectopascal, hectopascals | The millibar is a metric unit of pressure, but not part of the International System of Units (SI). It is defined as exactly equal to 1000 pascals, equivalent to 0.0145psi. |
| millibar scaler 16, millibars scaler 16 | This unit is the same as the millibar (above), only scaled by a factor of 1/16, ie: VALUE / 16; |
| pound-force per square inch, psi | The pound-force per square inch is an imperial unit of pressure. It is equivalent to 6894.76 pascals. |
| psi scaler 16k | This is the psi value scaled by 16K, using the formula: VALUE / 16384.0 |
| psi 4 over 16k | This is the psi value scaled using the formula: (4 / 16384.0) * VALUE |
| psi fs7 oil pressure | This is the psi value scaled using the formula: (55.0 / 16384) * VALUE. Only usually used when dealing with engine oil pressure. |
| pound-force per square foot, psf | The pound-force per square foot is an imperial unit of pressure. It is equivalent to 47.8803 pascals. |
| psf scaler 16k | This is the psf value scaled by 16K, using the formula: VALUE / 16384.0 |
