| Hertz, Hz, | The hertz is the derived unit of frequency in the International System of Units (SI) and is defined as one cycle per second. |
| Kilohertz, KHz | This is a measure of frequency equivalent to 1,000 cycles per second (103 hertz). |
| Megahertz, MHz | This is a measure of frequency equivalent to 1,000,000 cycles per second (106 hertz). |
| Frequency BCD16 | This is a definition of a frequency using a 16bit binary coded decimal. |
| Frequency BCD32 | This is a definition of a frequency using a 32bit binary coded decimal. |
| Frequency ADF BCD32 | This is a definition of an ADF frequency using a 32bit binary coded decimal. |
