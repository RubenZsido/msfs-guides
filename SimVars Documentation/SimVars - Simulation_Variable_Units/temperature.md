# Temperature

| kelvin | The kelvin is the base unit of temperature in the International System of Units (SI). The kelvin is the primary unit of temperature measurement for the physical sciences, but is often used in conjunction with the degree Celsius - which has the same magnitude - where 0 kelvin (called "Absolute Zero") corresponds to a temperature of -273.15°C. "Absolute Zero" is the equivalent -459.67°F. |
| rankine | The Rankine is a base unit of temperature, similar to the kelvin as 0 Rankine is the same as "Absolute Zero" kelvin. However the difference of 1 Rankine is defined as equal to 1 Fahrenheit degree, rather than the Celsius degree used on the kelvin scale. A temperature of 0K is equal to 0R which is the equivalent of -273.15°C or -459.67°F. |
| farenheit, fahrenheit | The Fahrenheit scale is a temperature scale based on two fixed points: the temperature at which pure water ice melts (32°F) and the temperature at which water boils (212°F) both at sea level and under standard atmospheric pressure. 0°F is equal to 255.372K, 459.67R or -17.7778°C. |
| celsius | The Celsius scale is a temperature scale based on 0°C for the freezing point of water and 100 °C for the boiling point of water at 1 atmosphere of pressure. 0°C is equal to 273.15K, 491.67R or 32°F |
| celsius fs7 egt | This the same as the Celsius unit only scaled by the following formula: VALUE / (1.8 * (6144 / 2060)). |
| celsius fs7 oil temp | This the same as the Celsius unit only scaled by the following formula: (VALUE - 273.15) * (16384 / 140.0). It is only used when dealing with engine oil temperature. |
| celsius scaler 1/256 | This unit is for degrees Celsius scaled by 1/256, eg: VALUE / 256. |
| celsius scaler 256 | This unit is for degrees Celsius scaled by 256, eg: VALUE * 256. |
| celsius scaler 16k | This unit is for degrees Celsius scaled by 16K, eg: VALUE * 16384.0. |
