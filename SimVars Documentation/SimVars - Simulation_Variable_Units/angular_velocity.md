# Angular velocity

| Units | Description |
| --- | --- |
| radian per second, radians per second | This is a unit of measurement that defines the number of radians that something will rotate for every second of time that passes. |
| revolution per minute, revolutions per minute, rpm, rpms | This is a unit of measurement that defines the number of full revolutions that something will complete for every minute of time that passes. A revolution is considered as a rotation of 360°. |
| rpm 1 over 16k | This is the same as the rpm unit, only scaled by 16K using the formula: VALUE / 16384.0 |
| minute per round, minutes per round | This is a unit of measurement that defines the number minutes that something will require for to complete a full round. A round is considered as a rotation of 360°. |
| nice minute per round, nice minutes per round | This is a unit of measurement that defines the number minutes that something will require for to complete a full round. A round is considered as a rotation of 360°. |
| degree per second, degrees per second | This is a unit of measurement that defines the number of degrees that something will rotate for every second of time that passes. |
| degree per second ang16, degrees per second ang16 | This is a unit of measurement that defines the number of degrees that something will rotate for every second of time that passes. The value is cast as a 16bit integer using the following formula: round(VALUE) / 65536.0 |
