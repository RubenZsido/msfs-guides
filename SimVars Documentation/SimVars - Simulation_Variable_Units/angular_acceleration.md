# Angular acceleration

| Units | Description |
| --- | --- |
| radian per second squared, radians per second squared | This is the unit of angular (rotational) acceleration magnitude in the International System of Units (SI). Essentially it is the rate of change of angular speed or velocity by one radian per second during a one second period. |
| degree per second squared, degrees per second squared | This is a unit of angular (rotational) acceleration magnitude. Essentially it is the rate of change of angular speed or velocity by one degree per second during a one second period. |
