| Units | Description |

| meter per second, meters/second, m/s | The metre per second is a unit of both speed and velocity in the International System of Units (SI). It is equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in one second of time. |
| meter per second scaler 256, meters per second scaler 256 | This is the same as the meter per second (above) only scaled by 1/256, ie: VALUE / 256. |
| meter per minute, meters per minute | The metre per minute is a unit of both speed and velocity in the metric system. It is equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one metre in one minute of time. |
| kilometer/hour, kilometers/hour, kilometers per hour, kph | The kilometer per hour is a unit of both speed and velocity in the metric system. It is equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one kilometer in one minute of time. |
| feet/second | The feet/second is a unit of both speed and velocity in the imperial system. It is equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one foot in one second of time. |
| feet/minute, ft/min | The feet/minute is a unit of both speed and velocity in the imperial system. It is equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one foot in one minute of time. |
| mile per hour, miles per hour, mph | The mile per hour is a unit of both speed and velocity in the imperial system. It is equal to the speed of a body covering a distance of one mile in one hour of time. |
| knot, knots | The knot is a unit of of both speed and velocity equal to one nautical mile per hour, which is 1.852kph using the metric scale and approximately 1.15078mph using the imperial scale. |
| knot scaler 128, knots scaler 128 | This is the same as the knot (above) only scaled by 1/128, ie: VALUE / 128. |
| mach, machs | A mach number is a unit of of both speed and velocity based on an aircraft's speed relative to the speed of sound. An aircraft travelling at mach 1 is equivalent to 1234.8kph or 767.27mph. |
| mach 3d2 over 64k | THis usnit will scale the mach value using the following formula: VALUE * (3.2 / 65536.0). |
